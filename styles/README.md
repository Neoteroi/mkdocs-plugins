# Source code for styles distributes in this package

To compile:

1. install `Sass` as described here https://sass-lang.com/install
2. use it to generate CSS files

## How to distribute

Currently there is no automation to compile SASS code into CSS, compiled files
are committed to `resources` folders inside package folders.
